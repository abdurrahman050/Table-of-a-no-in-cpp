# Multiplication Table Program in C++

This repository contains a simple C++ program that prints the multiplication table of a given number. It's a basic example to demonstrate how loops work in C++.

## Getting Started

To use this program, you'll need a C++ compiler installed on your system. The instructions below show how to compile and run the program.

### Prerequisites

- A C++ compiler such as `g++` from the [GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/).
- Alternatively, use an integrated development environment (IDE) like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/), or [Dev-C++](https://bloodshed.net/).
